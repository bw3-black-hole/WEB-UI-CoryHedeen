    <div class="title">About</div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The negativity bias implies that negative thoughts
          have a bigger impact on shaping behavior. The brain
          pays more attention to negative memories partly
          because they are more complex. From an evolutionary
          standpoint, this seems to be a survival mechanism.
          The brain takes more time to assess negativity in order
          to ensure that it knows how to handle the problem
          in the future. Thus, we are all doomed to have more
          negative than positive thoughts. That's why we created
          Black Hole. Black Hole allows you to engage negative
          thoughts by writing them down and then releasing those
          thoughts into the Universe.</p>
