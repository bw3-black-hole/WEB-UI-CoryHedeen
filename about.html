    <div class="title">About</div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The negativity bias implies that negative thoughts
          have a bigger impact on shaping behavior. The brain
          pays more attention to negative memories partly
          because they are more complex. From an evolutionary
          standpoint, this seems to be a survival mechanism.
          The brain takes more time to assess negativity in order
          to ensure that it knows how to handle the problem
          in the future. Thus, we are all doomed to have more
          negative than positive thoughts. That is why it is so
          important to engage those thoughts in a contained
          outlet so that we can process these thoughts more
          quickly. Black Hole is an innovative application that
          provides an outlet to release and engage negativity.</p>
