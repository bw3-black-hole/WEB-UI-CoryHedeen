    <p>Life is not always positive. Sometimes you get stuck in traffic. Other times
      they mess up your order at the coffee shop. There are quite a few things that
      you would like to tell your barista in the moment that are better left unsaid,
      but studies show that it is important to vent. Releasing negative thought has
      a significant impact on your mental health.</p>

        <p>Let Black Hole be an outlet for your frustrations.
          Anything you write in the Black Hole application can be destroyed with
          the click of a mouse. Tell your barista how you really feel. Blame your
          inertia on the blue Honda that just cut you off on the way to the
          turning lane. Not even negativity can escape the Black Hole.</p>
